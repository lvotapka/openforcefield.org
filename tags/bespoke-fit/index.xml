      <description>Our 4th annual workshop took place on June 11, 2021 in virtual space. Based on the feedback from the participants in this keynote event, we organized two follow-up workshops in September providing a more detailed overview of the benchmarking practices and results, and bespoke fitting infrastructure.
1. Benchmarking (Sep 1, 2021) The first follow-up workshop provided an overview of the methods used for the Season 1 of benchmarking and analysis of results from the private and public sets, and summarized progress on protein-ligand benchmarking.</description>
